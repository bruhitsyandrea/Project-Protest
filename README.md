# Project Protest

### Overview
Our project is an social justice web application, that helps the user find nearby marked protests in your local area. Such as if there is a climate change protest happening downtown, it will mark where the location is. Our purpose is to help guide people to social justice movements, and raise their voices.

### Setup
Many people use social medias to help gain traction and announce about a social justice movement happening around their area. But majority of the time most users swipe or don't even look at those posts because of short attention spans. This web application is designed to mark nearby protests and provide directions toward those locations to make it easier for people to find where those protests are. We focused on the theme **Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions**, but other goals that helped contribute to the main theme were the themes **Reduced Inequalities** and **Quality Education**. This is because social justice movements are our bread and butter when it comes to social changes that we don't agree with.

### Implementation
##### Technical components
* Backend
* Frontend
* Technologies
* Programming languages and Tools used

High Level components that we incorporated were **Firebase**, **Google Map API**, and **Dart/Futter**.
* **Firebase** is used to help store user information
* **Google Map API** helps us mark events on a map, and show protests in the users area

### Feedback / Testing / Iteration
The feedback we received were two factor authentication for users who worry about the safety of their account, and a filter for certain words that can cause hate speech. We mostly received positive feedback, but most of the feedback we have received were additional changes we can add onto the application to be more seamless and UI friendly.

One technical issue we had faced was getting access to certain Google APIs such as Google Maps because we had to wait on Google tokens in order to get access to the Google Map API. This delayed our progress for a couple days.

### Success and Completion of Solution
Our solution addresses the problem by making it more accessible to overview social justice movements. As our application is currently incomplete, we have worked on our login page before accessing the homepage, so the quantifiable data that is getting collected, is just user information for logging in with an account. 

### Scalability / Next Steps
The next steps working onto our project is refreshing the look of our web UI, making sure the user's safety is ensured, and working with the google map api to load directions if users are going to a movement by vehicle. To reach a larger audience, we would like to reach out to reliable social justice movement groups, as they can help us reach to a larger audience that loves to preach about social injustice.

We can successfully scale with a larger audience due to Google's APIs. The only data that will increase with a larger audience is the database for login credentials and event details. Google's database is able to support this application as the amount of data for these two items increases.
